<p>Make <strong>your own</strong> version of this takeaway favourite, complete with chilli and garlic sauces. Serve your homemade doner kebab with pitta bread and shredded cabbage</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>500 g lamb mince</li>
    <li>Pita bread or Wraps</li>
    <li>1 small onion</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves minced or finely grated</li>
    <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika</li>
    <li>sunflower oil for <em>oiling</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Let's cook!</h2>

<h4>STEP 1</h4>
<p>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with a large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together. You can also just squish everything together in a bowl but this will give you a looser finish.</p>

<h4>STEP 2</h4>
<p>Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick sausage, roughly the shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker shape.</p>

<h4>STEP 3</h4>
<p>Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, then unwrap the foil. Place back on the tray and brown under the grill or with a blowtorch.</p>

<h4>STEP 4</h4>
<p>Place on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a roasting fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments, including our chilli sauce and garlic yogurt sauce.</p>
