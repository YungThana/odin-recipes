<p>Sticky spiced wings make great finger food or canap√©s, and this version skips the deep-fried stage so they're healthier</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>500 g chicken wings</li>
    <li>3 tbsp cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
    <li>1 tbsp <em>Worcestershire</em> sauce</li>
    <li>4 tbsp <strong>hot sauce</strong></li>
    <li>3 tbsp honey</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let's cook!</h2>

<h4>STEP 1</h4>
<p>In a large bowl, mix together the garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, hot sauce, honey and a couple of cracks of black pepper. Add the chicken wings and toss around to make sure they're fully covered in the marinade. If you have time, leave the wings to marinate for a couple of hrs in the fridge or ideally overnight.</p>

<h4>STEP 2</h4>
<p>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Drain and reserve the marinade, then spread the wings out on a very large baking tray. Bake for 30 mins, then pour off the excess oil, add the reserved marinade and toss well. Increase oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Return to the oven and cook for a further 30 mins, tossing a few times to coat in the glaze as they cook. They should be sticky and glazed with most of the marinade evaporated. Serve on a large platter alongside other party snacks.</p>
